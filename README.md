## Installation

Add the dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/feather-framework/feather-storage-ephemeral", exact: "1.0.0-beta.1"),
```

Then add `FeatherStorageEphemeral` to your target dependencies:

```swift
.product(name: "FeatherStorageEphemeral", package: "feather-storage-ephemeral"),
```

## Usage

API documentation is available at the link below:

[
    ![DocC API documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/DocC-API_documentation-F05138)
](
    https://feather-framework.github.io/feather-storage-ephemeral/
)

Here is a brief example:

```swift
import NIOCore
import FeatherStorage
import FeatherStorageEphemeral

let storage = StorageClientEphemeral()

let text = "Hello, World"
var buffer = ByteBufferAllocator().buffer(capacity: text.utf8.count)
buffer.writeString(text)
    
try await storage.upload(
    key: "docs/hello.txt",
    sequence: StorageSequence(
        asyncSequence: ByteBufferSequence(buffer: buffer),
        length: UInt64(buffer.readableBytes)
    )
)

try await storage.exists(key: "docs/hello.txt")
try await storage.size(key: "docs/hello.txt")

let result = try await storage.download(key: "docs/hello.txt", range: nil)
let buffer = try await result.collect(upTo: .max)
let value = buffer.getString(at: 0, length: buffer.readableBytes)
print(value)
```
